# Problem 1:

```{r}
data = read.csv("C:/Users/13038/Downloads/homicide-data.csv") 
```

**Description of Raw Data:**

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
data = data%>%
  mutate(city_state = paste(city,state,sep=", "))

tab_1 = data%>%
  group_by(city_state)%>%
  summarise("Total Number of Homicides" = n())

tab_2 = data%>%
  group_by(city_state)%>%
  filter(disposition != "Closed by arrest")%>%
  summarise("Number of unsolved homicides" = n())

tab_final = merge(tab_1,tab_2,by = "city_state")%>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(`Total Number of Homicides`))

tab_final%>%
  knitr::kable()
```

```{r}
Baltimore_Unsolved = tab_final%>%
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

Baltimore_Unsolved = 
  prop.test(
            pull(Baltimore_Unsolved,`Number of unsolved homicides`),
            pull(Baltimore_Unsolved,`Total Number of Homicides`)
    )%>%
  broom::tidy()
```
